This Example showcases a very minor change to the key being used by the server, I've changed the keyname as this is a common modification. In the original folder this was a document that was 
generated by pulling the details for the specific EXAMPLE source server's launch template. It uses the Source Servers Name to identify the json file and references a launch template id from
within the file when uploading it back to AWS. What's important to note here is that the software will merge the two templates, so when you move/modify the file in original it will be erased 
and repopulated during the modification function actions. Also the application will only upload what is located in the Modified folder. It does so by referencing the launch template ID in the
json document and then merges the original document with the modified document. What is in the modified document will overwrite what was in the original, it doesn't matter if the original
document is in the directory or not when you perform the action just note that if you delete a key/value in the json document it will return through the merge process.
